This is a machine learning project.
I have taken a data set called “weatherAUS”, which have weather parameters of different dates and locations in Australia.
The data set had a lot of NaN values, I have cleared them using different methods (such as back fill, filling with the mean or the median, and using the average of the month). 
After that I tried a couple machine learning algorithms: KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes.
I concluded that Random Forest gives the best results.
